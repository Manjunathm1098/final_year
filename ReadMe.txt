Now find the steps suitable for your operating system to install the IDE:

Windows

Linux

Mac OS X

For Windows users
There are two choices for Windows version of L: Installer or ZIP file. You're recommended to use the Installer since it will automatically 
install the driver for Arduino IDE installation. So you can just download it and run the executable file to begin installation.
If you download the zip file, you need to unzip the file and install the driver by yourself.

Installation Process
Step 1: Find the .exe file just downloaded
Step 2: Double click the file and a window will pop up as below. Click I Agree.
Step 3: Click Next.
Step 4: Select the path to install. By default, it's set in the C disk: C:\Program Files\Arduino. You can click Browse and choose another path. Click OK. Then click Install.
Step 5: After the installation is done, click Close.

Please note that the new IDE may prompt errors when you're compiling code under Windows XP.
So if your computer is running on XP, you're suggested to install Arduino 1.0.5 or 1.0.6. Also you can upgrade your computer.
Open the Arduino Software (IDE)
Double-click the Arduino icon (arduino.exe) created by the installation process
Then the Arduino IDE will appear.
